Let's start building a honey pot from scratch using raspberry pi

Take an SD card with minimum 4 GB of size (recommended minimum 16 GB) and insert it using an adapter to any computer/laptop
Go to https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/ and download the "Pi Imager" for your Operating System.
After running the Pi Imager make sure you select the preferred OS, I recommend the basic complete install. 
After you select the OS and the memory card, Press "Ctrl+Shift+X" for additional settings.
You can select the Wireless network you want the pi to connect to and also remember enable SSH, and enter your preferred passcode
Make sure you note down the "hostname" somewhere as it is useful to ssh for first time.
Click "Save" and Write the OSimage tothe memory card.
Once everything is done, take out the memory card from the adapter and place it carefull in the Raspberry Pi.
Plug the Pi to the power supply and wait for atleast 10 min.
Make sure your laptop is connected to the same network as the Pi and open the terminal/command prompt and type the following

> ssh pi@<hostname as in the Pi Imager>
(type "yes" and the password as prompted)

If you get the command prompt as the Raspberry Pi, you've successfully ssh-ed into the Pi.
If you get any error, try

> ping raspberrypi.local

If you get a response, note the ip and try ssh-ing into the pi with the ip address
If you do not get a response, either the raspberry pi is not completely booted or there is some error,
Wait for some time and try ssh-ing again, if you still get an error, restart from the OS imaging process.

Once you get the Raspberry Pi command line, follow these steps.

$ ifconfig (note the ip, as everytime you connect to the same home network, ip does not change)

(changing the mac address)
$ sudo apt install macchanger
$ macchanger -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
(if the above steps donot work)
$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
(add the following in the end of the file)
. . . smsc95xx.macaddr=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
$ sudo reboot now (to apply the changes)

(Pre-Requisites and Open-Canary software)
$ sudo apt-get install git python-virtualenv python-pip python-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install â€“upgrade pip setuptools

(Cloning and installing the opencanary)
$ git clone https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary
$ cd opencanary
$ sudo python setup.py install
(additional commands)
$ sudo link /usr/local/bin/twistd /home/pi/venv/bin/twistd
$ sudo link /usr/local/bin/twistd /home/pi/opencanary/bin/twistd
$ cp /home/pi/opencanary/build/scripts-3.7(or 2.7)/opencanary.tac /home/pi/venv/bin/opencanary.tac
$ sudo cp ./build/scripts-3.7(or 2.7)/opencanary.tac /usr/local/bin/opencanary.tac

(Configuration)
$ sudo nano /home/pi/opencanary/opencanary.conf
(copy the opencanary.conf from the repository files)
$ opencanaryd --dev

(Autostart the service at boot)
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/opencanary.service
(copy the code from opencanary.service in repo files)
(change the paths if you've saved them in different directories)
$ sudo systemctl enable opencanary.service
$ sudo systemctl start opencanary.service
$ systemctl status opencanary.service
$ sudo reboot now
(check whether the service is running)
$ systemctl status opencanary.service
$ sudo chmod 666 /var/tmp/opencanary-tmp.log

(send data to mail and visualize)
$ mkdir /home/pi/opencanary/logtool
$ nano /home/pi/opencanary/logtool/log-reader.py
(copy the code from log-reader.py in repo files to send mail)
$ crontab -e
(select 1 (nano) when prompted)
(then at the end of the file add the line)
* * * * * python /home/pi/opencanary/logtool/log-reader.py
$ sudo reboot now

(if everything went without any major errors, your honey pot is ready.)

NOTE: if the Raspberry Pi gets shutdown in any abnormal way, the opencanary is rebooted automtically, 
      if the opencanary is not running, remove the file /home/pi/opencanary/twistd.pid and reboot the Pi.
